## How the computer works 
#### Computers were designed to manipulate information
#### The original pioneers of the computer determined computers should do 4 main things
- Take inputs: Computer can take in various types of input, it can listen to your heartbeat and a bunch of other things
- Store information - all those information are then stored in memory
- Process information- takes the information and manipulates it with algorithm an then stores it back in memory till it is ready to be output
- Output result- The ouput can be displayed as text , photos, videos etc

*sidenote: Computers were large and took time to process information. They started out doing only basic calculations, now they can be used for wide range of things* 

### Binaries and data
- Binaries are the backbone of how computers input, store, process and output information. Binary system includes just 1s and 0s.
- Bits are 1s and 0s and are the smallest piece of information that can be stored in a computer
- In decimal series there are 10 numbers 0-10, but in the binary series, ther are just 2 numbers, 0 and 1, for example, 9 in the binary system is 1001
- wire contains just 1s and 0s, the more wire you use the more 1s and 0s you can store. With 8 wires you can store 0 to 255
- Text images and sound can also be represented in binary.

### CPU, memory, Input and Output
- Each of the input, storing, processing and output of data are done by different parts of the computer
- Input devices takes inputs from the outside world and convert it to binary information
- Then there is memory to store this information, Then there is CPU where all the calculations are done
- Then there are output devices that take this information that take this information and convert them into physical output
