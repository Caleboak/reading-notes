## What is Markdown?
### Markdown is a markup language used to create formatted text, typically for publishing on the internet. If you want to create a quick website with just a few syntax, markdown is your best bet.
### Markdown is way easier and faster because it is just plain test with stuffs added to it to give it a different apperance.
- Headers: You just add *#* to the beginning of each sentence and it automatically becomes a header. The more *#* you add determines how smaller you want the font to be. E.g *# Topic* has a bigger font than *## Topic* and so on.

- Italics: You can italicize text by wrapping it in single asterisks just to put more attention to that word. Example `*Japan*` results in *Japan*

- Bold: You can grab the attention of your readers by making it bold. You can do this by just adding double asteriks to the beginning and ending of your word. For Example `**Golang**` results in **Golang**

- Unordered and ordered list: Sometimes you would want to list some items. For unordered list there are varieties of ways, by adding asteriks "*" or "-" before the sentence it immediately becomes a bullet point.
For ordered list, you can just number it followed by a period "`1. School is def not fun`"

- Hyperlinks : Making clickable links is way easy. Just a combination of brackets for the anchor text and parentheses for the URL. So you put the anchor text in a straight bracket and URL in the parenthesis and you would get the example. Example  `[website link here](https://www.makeuseof.com/)` results in [website link here](https://www.makeuseof.com/)

- Images: Adding images is almost like hyperlinks apart from the exclamation mark added in front. Start with an exclamation point. After this, place brackets containing the image alt text (which is optional), then finally put the URL of the image in parentheses. EXample `![WhatsApp to Telegram](https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/How-to-Move-WhatsApp-Chats-History-to-Telegram.png)`

- Quotes- If you want to write a quotes. You can do this by just adding the greater than symbol before the text.
`> "Caleb is the greatest"` results in
> "Caleb is the greatest"
