<h1 align="center">Hi Caleb hereðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a college student studying Computer Science. I'm currently interning as a software Engineer, working with Golang as my programming language and linux as my operating system. I have had issues in the past with dodging responsibilities or trying to learn something new. I believe i have overcomed it or sort of. I've never used Golang before, but I am currently learning as I'm working with it. My old self would have dodged it for something i already know. I am happy with the changes i've made, it's been amazing so far. Ya, that's just me. I hope this contents affect you in a positive way. </h3>
