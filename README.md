## What does it mean to have a growth mindset?
*An individual with a growth mindset is someone who believes and strifes to get better. They don't believe they are where they want to be but know they are just on the journey to where they can be. Having a growth mindset is important in every aspect of life, be it as a professional or a student.*

<h1 align="center">Hi Caleb hereðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a college student studying Computer Science. I'm currently interning as a software Engineer, working with Golang as my programming language and linux as my operating system. I have had issues in the past with dodging responsibilities or trying to learn something new. I believe i have overcomed it or sort of. I've never used Golang before, but I am currently learning as I'm working with it. My old self would have dodged it for something i already know. I am happy with the changes i've made, it's been amazing so far. Ya, that's just me. I hope this content affects you in a positive way. </h3>

## Having a groth mindset vs having a fixed mindset
*The main difference between this two is clear. An individual with a fixed mindset believes he/she is where they are meant to be and don't believe they can be any better. Once these set of people are criticised, they don't try to learn from it, they immediately take it personal and give up. Someone with a growth mindset sees every criticism as an opportunity to learn and grow. An uncritisized man will continue to do what he/she likes-whether right or wrong.*

### Message to myself
- Always be persistent and never give up
- When struggling with a task, keep in mind you have not mastered it yet: 
- Making a mistake is fine, it's just a learning experience: 
  It's not bad when you make a mistake, but it's bad when you don't learn from them.
- Don't focus on the journey but the destination. It might take long but i will get there: Don't compare your learning process with others. People are different and have different learning styles and speed.
- Don't let criticism pull me down, instead learn from it: 
- Always be flexible - try other ways
- It's alright to be stressed, take a break
