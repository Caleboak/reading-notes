## What does it mean to have a growth mindset?
*An individual with a growth mindset is someone who believes and strifes to get better. They don't believe they are where they want to be but know they are just on the journey to where they can be*

### Message to myself
- Always be persistent and never give up
- When struggling with a task, keep in mind you have not mastered yet.
- Making a mistake is fine, it's just a learning experience
- Don't focus on the journey but the destination. It might take long but i will get there.
- Don't let criticism pull me down, instead learn from it
- Always be flexible - try other ways
- It's alright to be stressed, take a break
