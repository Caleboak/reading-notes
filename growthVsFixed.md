## Having a groth mindset vs having a fixed mindset
*The main difference between this two is clear. An individual with a fixed mindset believes he/she is where they are meant to be and don't believe they can be any better. Once these set of people are criticised, they don't try to learn from it, they immediately give up. Someone with a growth mindset sees every criticism as an opportunity to learn and grow. An uncritisized man will continue to do what he/she does-whether right or wrong.*
