## What is a WIREFRAME?
### Wireframes are simple black and white layouts that outline the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas and navigation for your website.
### Wireframing is a process where designers draw a plan to establish the contents of a page or the flow of possible design solutions. This portrays the business or user's need.
### A good wireframe leads to good designs amd powerful prototypes

### Designers usually use either online wireframe tools or pen and paper to draw their plan. Pen and paper is more flexible as it allows for easier change and can easily be shown to clients or users

## Example of wireframe tools
- UXPin
- InVision
- Wireframe.cc

## Steps to make a wireframe
- Do your research: Before picking up your paper and pen, you are expected to your research
- Prepare your research for quick reference
- Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
- Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
- Add some detail and get testing
- Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

**A good wireframe must have clarity, be simple and instill confidence in your client**

# HTML
## what is HTML?
### HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
> "My cat is a dog" can appear as `<p>my cat is a dog</p>` with p as a paragraph tag
- That consisted of an opening tag, closing tag and its content

- Attributes: Elements can have attribute. Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. 
> `<h1 class="edit">My dog is now a cat</h1>`
*The class is the attribute name and "edit" is the value*

- Nesting Elements: You can add more tags in an existing tag. For example if you want to add emphasis to a word, you can use the "strong" tag.
> `<p>My dog is now a<strong>Cat</strong>.</p>`    <p>My dog is now a<strong>Cat</strong>.</p>

## Anatomy of a HTML document
- Heading: Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings
> `<h1>My main header</h1>`
- Paragraphs: for containing paragraphs of text
> `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`
- Links: To add a link, we need to use a simple element — `<a>` — "a" being the short form for "anchor". Example:
> `<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>`
- Images : To add images to the web, you need the "img" tag and the "alt" which is optional. The "alt" tag shows a text if the image link doesn't work. Example
> `<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">`
