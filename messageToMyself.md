### Message to myself
- Always be persistent and never give up
- When struggling with a task, keep in mind you have not mastered it yet: 
- Making a mistake is fine, it's just a learning experience: 
  It's not bad when you make a mistake, but it's bad when you don't learn from them.
- Don't focus on the journey but the destination. It might take long but i will get there: Don't compare your learning process with others. People are different and have different learning styles and speed.
- Don't let criticism pull me down, instead learn from it: 
- Always be flexible - try other ways
- It's alright to be stressed, take a break
